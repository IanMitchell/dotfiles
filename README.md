# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for all my machines! I use these on macOS, Windows WSL2, and GitHub Codespaces.

It uses zsh, [Starship](https://starship.rs/), [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa), [tldr](https://tldr.sh), and [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta).

## Usage

Clone this repository to your machine and then run the following command:

    $ ./install

Any existing dotfiles will be saved under `~/<name>.backup`
